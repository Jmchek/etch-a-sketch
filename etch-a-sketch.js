// Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
// Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
// It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).
// There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Feel free to use any or play with each of them:
// float/clear
// inline-block
// flexbox
// CSS Grid
// Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares!


//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// create 16x16 square divs using js only
// center the container div to be more presentable
// use loops to create the first row
// create each grid by creating a new div and appending?
// repeat until we hit the end of the 16th row and finish
// place them in the "container" div
// make them appear as a grid
